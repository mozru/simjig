//! The flight recorder: a bounded ring of the most recent kernel events, plus a running
//! hash of *every* event recorded.
//!
//! The ring answers "what happened just before the failure". The hash is the determinism
//! check (DECISION §2 row 4): two runs of the same test with the same seed must produce the
//! same hash. Records therefore hold only deterministic data (times, slot numbers, task
//! keys from the deterministic slab), never addresses or the global simulation id.
