# Changelog

All notable changes to simjig. Constitution rule 4 requires an entry for every change to
the public API, the generated code or simulation semantics.

## Unreleased
- Initial workspace:
  - `svtypes`: the IR from Verilator `--json-only`;
  - `simjig-bits`: bit-vector values;
  - `simjig-build`: the pipeline, codegen and C ABI runtime;
  - `simjig`: kernel, model, typed handles, harness;
  - `simjig-macros`: `#[simjig::test]`;
  - `cargo-simjig`: `doctor`.
- C ABI version 1, vtable size 192, with trace, coverage and RNG slots.
- IR schema 2: adds `unrepresentable` constants.
- Scheduler: `Timer`s due at the same time fire one at a time, in registration order,
  each followed by every task it makes ready (and every task those wake), as cocotb runs
  its event loop after each Timer callback. Before, all of them woke together and tasks
  they woke ran after the last Timer task.
- `with_timeout` breaks ties as cocotb 2.1 does (golden `timeout_ties`): the timeout's
  Timer registers before the future's triggers and is checked first, so a `Timer`,
  edge or `cycles` due exactly at the timeout now times out (a future's own `Timer` used
  to win); a spawned task whose `Timer` was registered before the call still returns its
  result.
- `BlockedTask` implements `Display` (`` `main.d` awaits rising(clk) ``), the rendering
  `Failure`'s `Display` and the failure report share.
